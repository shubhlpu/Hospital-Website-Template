  <summary><h1>HMS Overview</h1></summary>
  <p>
    It was in 1983, that Dr. Krishna Chaitanya made a pioneering endeavor by launching India's first corporate hospital - HMS in Gurgaon. Now, as Asia's foremost and trusted integrated healthcare services provider, the group's presence includes Hospitals, Pharmacies, Primary Care & Diagnostic Clinics and Telemedicine units across 10 countries, Health Insurance Services, Global Projects Consultancy, Colleges of Nursing and Hospital Management and a Research Foundation with focus on Global Clinical Trials, epidemiological studies, stem cell & genetic research. Today, we are consistently ranked amongst the best hospitals globally for advanced medical services and it has touched the lives of over 45 million patients, from 121 countries.

Over the past three decades, our transformative journey has forged a legacy of excellence in Indian healthcare. One of our significant contributions has been the adoption of clinical excellence as an industry standard. Alongside, its ethos rests on the pillars of technological superiority, a warm patient - centric approach, affordable costs and an edge in forward-looking research and academics.

HMS was the first to invest in the pre-requisites that led to international Quality accreditation like the Joint Commission International and Indraprastha. HMS was the first hospital in India to be accredited with this gold standard in 2006.

An early adopter of technology, HMS was one among the first few in the world to leverage technology to build integrated healthcare delivery models, which facilitate seamless healthcare delivery through electronic medical records, hospital information systems and telemedicine-based outreach initiatives. Another critical manifestation of widespread technology has been the amazing advancement in medical equipment and HMS has repeatedly pioneered the introduction of such innovations in India. Soon the country will have its very first Proton Beam Therapy Cell at HMS Cancer Centre.

Tender Loving Care (TLC) was at the core of our model of care and it continues to be the magic that inspires hope, warmth and a sense of ease in the patients. Processes are relentlessly improved upon to ensure maximum patient-centricity.

  <summary><h1>Our Vision</h1></summary>

<p style=" margin-left: 150px; width: 650px ">&nbsp;Our vision for the next phase of development is to 'Touch a Billion Lives'.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><h1>Mission Statement</h1></summary>
  <p>"Our mission is to bring healthcare of International standards within the reach of every individual. We are committed to the achievement and maintenance of excellence in education, research and healthcare for the benefit of humanity".

HMS has taken the spirit of leadership well beyond business metrics. It has embraced the onus of keeping India, healthy. Taking cognizance of the undeniable fact that India is reeling under the onslaught of Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs), HMS has assumed the responsibility to educate and influence mind set of the people of India. Increased focus on tactical initiatives like personalized preventive healthcare bears testimony to this new thrust. On January 1, 2015, HMS declared war on NCDs, and is leading the entire healthcare fraternity into this battle. The Billion Hearts Beating Foundation was envisioned by Dr. Krishna to keep India heart healthy and over half a million people have taken a pledge on www.billionheartsbeat.com

We have always strongly believed in social initiatives that help transcend barriers. In keeping with this, the group has started several impactful programmes. SACHi (Save a Child's Heart Initiative) - a community service initiative was introduced with the aim of providing quality pediatric cardiac care to children from underprivileged sections of society suffering from heart diseases. HMS also runs the SAHI (Society to Aid the Hearing Impaired) and the CURE Foundation, focused on cancer screening, cure and rehabilitation for those from a financially challenged background.</p>

  <summary><h1>More About Us</h1></summary>
  <p>In addition to offering traditional and established medical care services, HMS is distinguished with its tertiary and quaternary services. This means we have the personnel and facilities to provide advanced medical inquiry and treatments that are not widely accessible in this region.
Whether a patient is coming in for a routine or a specialized procedure, they will always benefit from our unique ability to quickly implement the newest discoveries and advancements in medicine. A few of our many highly-specialized services include:

• Organ Transplant
• Trauma and Burn Care
• Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
• Comprehensive Neuro-medicine
• Complex Cardiology
• Cancer Service

Many of our specialty programs consistently rank among “India’s Best Hospitals” and earned top honors in the first-ever “Best Regional Hospitals” 2015-16 ranking according to Times News & World Health Report. With 739 beds, most patients come from northern India but over 35 percent come from even southern states.</p>

  <summary><h1>How We Do It</h1></summary>
  <p>HMS is an exemplary teaching hospital with advanced scientific proficiencies, robust patient care services, and formidable community relations. These qualities and the dedicated staff who support them are precisely what elevate our reputation. As a teaching hospital, all of our medical clinicians are clinician scholars with faculty appointments (at the AIIMS, New Delhi) who supervise residents and participate in the education of residents and students. The result is a learning environment immersed in research, education, community, and innovation—Medicine of the Highest Order.

HMS is also characterized by having medical clinicians who are comfortable working with many other specialists in an interdisciplinary, team-based environment. Familiarity and ease with this level of collaboration allows staff to harness the powerful interaction of three distinct but interrelated missions: research, education, and patient care. The fruit of this interaction is found in not only how clinicians teach but also how they practice. Indeed, all of staff is committed to consistently delivering a high-quality patient experience. This includes working to build partnerships with patients and their families along with identifying ways to empower patients with information and the tools they need to make informed decisions about their health care.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h1>What This Means for You</h1></summary>
  <p>As a result of this approach, each and every patient has an extensive number of specialists who can be seamlessly integrated into their health care team. A condition is never isolated. Patients always have a team of people and specialists taking care of them, all supported with the highest technology. That technology also applies to communication. All of a patient’s medical information is consolidated into a single medical record thus eliminating potential for miscommunication.

This means that if you go in for a standard procedure and there is a complication, a specialist is on hand to be instantly included into your health care team. Moreover, that specialist represents the most advanced medical care and research. When you combine this expertise with our philosophy of developing a meaningful partnership with patients and families the result is nothing short of a transformational patient experience.</p>
